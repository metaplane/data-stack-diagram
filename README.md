## Logos

To add a logo for an integration, create a file at `logo/{integration}.svg`.

Each icon file in this directory should:

- [ ] be an SVG named `{sourceType}.svg`
- [ ] have an entry in [SuperBrandIconUrls](https://github.com/metaplane/metaplane-frontend/blob/29dadf4f98ab684612f7d0afd480587dc9b173dd/packages/super/src/SuperIcon/SuperBrandIcon.tsx#L29)
- [ ] be 400px by 400px
- [ ] have a transparent background
- [ ] be centered and fit as tightly as possible to the 400x400 box
